# Recipeme Frontend

I built recipeme because I wanted to build a cool app that lets a user search up a recipe by ingredient or recipe name and receive a variety of recipes!

I chose ruby on rails because this was when I was first getting into backend development and wanted to have a working product asap. Also, ROR is an awesome
backend language fir a beginner.
